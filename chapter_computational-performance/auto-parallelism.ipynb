For example, the `dot` operator will use all cores (and threads) on all CPUs, even if there are multiple CPU processors on a single machine. The same applies to a single GPU. Hence parallelization is not quite so useful for single-device computers. With multiple devices things matter more. While parallelization is typically most relevant between multiple GPUs, adding the local CPU will increase performance slightly. For example, see :citet:`Hadjis.Zhang.Mitliagkas.ea.2016` that focuses on training computer vision models combining a GPU and a CPU. With the convenience of an automatically parallelizing framework we can accomplish the same goal in a few lines of Python code. More broadly, our discussion of automatic parallel computation focuses on parallel computation using both CPUs and GPUs, as well as the parallelization of computation and communication.\n",

This situation occurs, e.g., when we compute the (backprop) gradient on a minibatch. The gradients of some of the parameters will be available earlier than that of others. Hence it works to our advantage to start using PCI-Express bus bandwidth while the GPU is still running. In PyTorch, several functions such as `to()` and `copy_()` admit an explicit `non_blocking` argument, which lets the caller bypass synchronization when it is unnecessary. Setting `non_blocking=True` allows us to simulate this scenario.\n"
